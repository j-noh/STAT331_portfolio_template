<span style="color: red;">We frequently use the distinct() function in this class, but this will work as well. However, I specifically requested an output that summarizes how many words, not the actual words. Consider the nature of the data when plotting. Is every participant on one row? If not, what should you do with the data before plotting it? Look at your y-axis values? Do those make sense?</span>

Reflection: In my previous attempt, I had printed out each unique word in the dataset rather than just getting a count. I resolved this issue by finding the necessary function during office hours. Additionally, my graphs had 4000 as a count for age which made no sense for the dataset because there were only 168 people. I resolved this with the distinct function to remove all repeated rows only keeping unique observations to set my graph up in a way that made sense in regards to the dataset.

<span style = "color: red;">We use boxplots to plot the relationship between one numerical variable and one categorical variable. What type of plot is more suitable for two numerical variables? Having clear axis labels is an absolute must for every plot we make. If you transformed a variable (like taking the log) your axis should clearly state what transformation you used. Additionally, this seems like a great place for some annotations instead of a legend! Or, you could play with the location of your legend!</span>

Reflection: My first attempt I believed a boxplot would be better suited because I wanted to plot regions and how the total avocado sales would vary based on price, but a boxplot does not a do a very good job of plotting 2 quantitative variables. A scatterplot would be best suited for this because it can graph 2 quant variables, but also it is easier to compare total avocado sales by size and type with this type of graph as opposed to a boxplot.My earlier graph was messy to look at and understand because I had not specified my scaling even though I did use a scale of log10. I have learned now that labeling is a very important aspect of visualizations otherwise people will be confused at what they're looking at Additionally, my legend made the graph a little dizzying to look at. I used annotations to fix this issue so my graph is clearer to look at.

<span style = "color: red;">Thereâ€™s something going on with these lines! geom_line() expects for there to be one observation for each year. Is that the case? If not, what can you do to make this the case?</span>

Reflection: In my previous response I had a line chart with many lines that were overlapping and messy to look at, this was because the data I was plotting had many observations for a single year but the geom_line is not able to plot that. I resolved this by finding a summary statistic for each year based on species and river type resulting in only 2 lines for each of my graphs.
