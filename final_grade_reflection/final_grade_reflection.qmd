I believe I have earned an A in this class because I have been able to meet every learning target, challenge myself to make better documents, and have contributed to being a good classmate. In lab 4 #1 I met targets WD-1 and R-1. Target WD-6 was shown in lab 4 #9 and WD-4, WD-7 in lab 4 #10. WD-3 was shown in lab 4 \# 4. DVS-2 was in lab 5 #3 along with DVS-1 which was shown in lab 5 #4, 5, 6. DSM-2 was found in lab 9 #2, 3, 4. WD-5 was located in preview activity 4 #4-6. DVS-4 was in lab 9 #1 along with PE-1 which was found in lab 9 #1a. DVS-6 and DVS-7 can both be found in challenge 9 #5. DVS-5 was found in lab 7 #2 along with R-3, PE-2 in lab 7 #4 and #8. R-3 can also be found in lab 3 #10. Lab 3 #9 contains WD-2. PE-3 was found in Lab 8 #2 and 6. DSM-1 is in practice activity 9 #4 and 4a.
